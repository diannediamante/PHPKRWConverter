## Currency Converter (PHP to KRW and KRW to PHP)
	- Simple Currency Converter which involves Philippine Peso and Korean Won
	- Combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript

### Features:
   * Converts PHP to KRW and vice versa
   * Element sizes are responsive to the screen size
   		> viewport width (vw) is used
   * The text boxes are used for input and output
   		> Only one textbox should have an input before the convertion
   		> The nonempty textbox is the one to be converted
   		> The converted value will be placed on the empty textbox
   * Some Alerts/Prompts
   		> Both textboxes are empty
   		> Both textboxes are not empty
   		> Input is invalid (not a number)
   			> Fixed using the isNaN() Function
   * Fix the value in 2 decimal places

### For Further Improvements:
   * Increase the number of currency pairs that can be converted
   * Libraries can be used to make the conversion real-time
   		> To make the result accurate even if there's a change in the equivalent rates of the currencies
   * Designs can be further improved
   * Character limits can be added on the input and output
   * Commas can be added as separators to make bigger values easy to read
   * Codes for HTML, CSS, and JS can be separated into different files to make the JS and CSS files useful to other HTML files especially the JS functions
